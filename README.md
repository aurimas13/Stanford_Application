**Hello and welcome!** I share my journey towards applying to Stanford University. This repository is a unique blend of my personal story, my ambitious research proposal for Stanford, and a showcase of my problem-solving skills through coding challenges.

## üìò Personal Story

Dive into my [Personal Journey](https://github.com/aurimas13/Stanford_Application/blob/main/Personal_Story_Stanford.pdf), where I narrate my aspirations, challenges, and triumphs that have shaped my academic and professional path. From a childhood dream of coming to the United States üá∫üá∏ to overcoming significant adversities, my story is one of resilience and determination.

## üß¨ Research Proposal
Explore my [Research Proposal for Stanford](https://github.com/aurimas13/Stanford_Application/blob/main/Research_Proposal_Stanford.pdf) titled "Developing AGI Frameworks for Personalized Healthcare and Mental Health." This document outlines my vision for leveraging Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) in healthcare, focusing on personalization, predictive analysis, and mental health applications.

## üñ•Ô∏è A Problem A Day
As a testament to my analytical and coding skills, check out my [Solutions-To-Problems](https://github.com/aurimas13/Solutions-To-Problems) repository, where I solve computational problem a day and have solved over 700 problems to date. Still counting. 

- üé• First video solutions of hard and easy diffulty problems showing how I handled it, demonstrating my approach to problem-solving can be accesed through [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/Stanford_Application/tree/main/Video/1_Solution_Hard.mp4) and [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/Stanford_Application/blob/main/Video/2_Solution_Easy.mp4) or watched through website [here](https://www.loom.com/share/b8d29d93edbc4d8e8ed12dc4a328f0f8?sid=34ae80d3-46e1-4b6b-9045-0781bfa6ba9a) and [here](https://www.loom.com/share/4fb7f19dc1d346b69312563ddcfefe3f?sid=c8ee5b4d-3363-4cd2-92d1-4646d00dcef5) while their actual solutions and the problem descriptions can be accesed through [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/Solutions-To-Problems/tree/main/LeetCode/Python%20Solutions/Arithmetic%20Slices%20II%20-%20Subsequence) and [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/Solutions-To-Problems/tree/main/LeetCode/Python%20Solutions/Leaf-Similar%20Trees).
