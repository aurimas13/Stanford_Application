**Hello and welcome!** I share my journey towards applying to Stanford University. This repository is a unique blend of my personal story, my ambitious research proposal for Stanford, and a showcase of my problem-solving skills through coding challenges.

## üìò My Personal Story

Dive into my [Personal Journey](https://github.com/aurimas13/Stanford_Application/blob/main/BIO_Stanford_PS.pdf), where I narrate my aspirations, challenges, and triumphs that have shaped my academic and professional path. From a childhood dream of coming to the United States üá∫üá∏ to overcoming significant adversities, my story is one of resilience and determination.

## üß¨ Research Proposal for Stanford
Explore my [Research Proposal](https://github.com/aurimas13/Stanford_Application/blob/main/Research_Proposal_Stanford.pdf) titled "Developing AGI Frameworks for Personalized Healthcare and Mental Health". This document outlines my vision for leveraging Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) in healthcare, focusing on personalization, predictive analysis, and mental health applications.

## üñ•Ô∏è A Problem A Day
As a testament to my analytical and coding skills, check out my [Solutions-To-Problems](https://github.com/aurimas13/Solutions-To-Problems) repository, where I solve computational problem a day and have solved over 500 problems to date. Still counting. 

- üé• Coming Soon: Watch some of these solutions come to life in video format, demonstrating my approach to complex problem-solving.
